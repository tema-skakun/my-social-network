## my-social-network

This is a Single Page Application is implemented on the React library, state management is implemented using Redux-Toolkit.
The backend is implemented as a REST API ([API documentation](https://social-network.samuraijs.com/docs)), and I interact with it using the Axios library.

![project architecture](https://github.com/tema-skakun/my-social-network/blob/main/public/architecture_of_project.png)

 - UIâ€ƒ- user interface;
 - BLL - business logic layer;
 - DAL - data access layer.

As part of this project, I want to implement:
  - user profile;
  - messenger;
  - searching and adding users to friends;
  - news feed;
  - page with music;
  - profile settings;
  - changing the application language.
